Hieracharchal indexing
Time series - getting pats of date, indexing and resampling/upsampling/downsampling/interpolation/moving window,
Missing data -np.nan/ fill/ sci-kit imputer
Duplicates
Filtering - masks/boolean logic/mask = (x > 0.5) & (y < 0.5) &/| - show can be used to count too as equal to 1
Mapping data using dictionary
Replace using pandas
String manupulation - split (combine with get to get first/last word), regular expressions, contains, match, isin, capatlize, starts with/ends with, isnumeric, is decimal, remove punctuation https://chrisalbon.com/machine_learning/preprocessing_text/remove_punctuation/, replace, whitespace
Stacking/ unstacking
Group and operations like sum (group with dictionaries)
Dummies/ one hot encoding (dictvectorizer and get dummies)
Joining/ Merging on index/ concatenate
np.where - look where used
Pivoting/ melting
lambda/Apply/ Map function
slicing - iloc/loc/column
numpy_arrays - reshaping/copying/concatenate/split/index or slicing/ naming cols or rows/ arithemetic or operators (min, max, sum, argmax)/ absolute/np.sort/ zeros or identity or ones/
broadcasting
freq table/ unique counts
